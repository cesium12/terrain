You need Cython and various OpenGL-related things. If you have those, running
    python viewer_setup.py build
should successfully compile a viewer library and hide it somewhere like
    build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/viewer.so
Copy or link it to the root directory. Then
    python examples.py 
should give you a list of examples, and
    python examples.py <number or name> [parameter=value] ...
should give you pretty pictures with mouse and keyboard control.
